### Coefficient of Utilization (CU)
* CU is the fraction of the initial lamp lumens that ultimately reaches the work plane, both directly and from reflection.
* CU includes both the efficiency of the luminaire in releasing lamp lumens into the interior space and the efficiency of the room surfaces in redirecting these lumens to the work plane.
* CU table is usually provided when the luminaire is tested as an Indoor luminaire (IES LM-46-04).

### Spacing Criterion (SC)
* The luminaire spacing criterion (SC) is a classification technique for interior luminaires relating to the spread or
distribution of the illuminance on a horizontal plane. It tests the uniformity of horizontal illuminance at two pairs of
selected points to estimate the probable extreme limit of acceptable luminaire spacing.
* The luminaire spacing criterion only suggests a maximum spacing at which the horizontal illuminance is reasonably
uniform. When other criteria are considered, such as overlap between luminaires, vertical illuminance, shadowing,
and illuminance distribution above the work plane, it generally is found that luminaires need to be installed at some
spacing-to-mounting height ratio less than the value of the luminaire spacing criterion.
