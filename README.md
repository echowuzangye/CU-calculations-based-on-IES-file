### Coefficient of Utilization (CU)
* CU is the fraction of the initial lamp lumens that ultimately reaches the work plane, both directly and from reflection.
* CU includes both the efficiency of the luminaire in releasing lamp lumens into the interior space and the efficiency of the room surfaces in redirecting these lumens to the work plane.
* CU table is usually provided when the luminaire is tested as Indoor luminaires.
